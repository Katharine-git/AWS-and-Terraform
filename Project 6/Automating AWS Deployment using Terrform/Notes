we will learn how to automate AWS infrastructure deployments using Terraform and integrate these processes into a CI/CD pipeline utilizing AWS CodePipeline. 
Automating these workflows can significantly reduce manual errors and increase deployment efficiency.

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages ready for deployment.

a  "build spec" file in AWS CodeBuild is A file that defines the steps and commands to run during the build process.

When configuring an AWS CodePipeline to use Terraform, AWS CodeBuild can be used to run the Terraform commands.

When setting up a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform, the buildspec.yml file is used to define the actions in the build and deploy stages.
